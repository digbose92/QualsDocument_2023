\section{MM-AU Experiments}
\label{app:language_baselines}
\subsection{Language based reasoning}

We investigate the zero-shot performance of several large language models i.e. \texttt{GPT-4}\cite{OpenAI2023GPT4TR}, \texttt{Opt-IML} \cite{Iyer2022OPTIMLSL}, \texttt{Flan-T5} (XXL,XL,L) \cite{Chung2022ScalingIL} and \texttt{Alpaca} \cite{alpaca} on the benchmark tasks associated with \textbf{MM-AU} dataset. For zero-shot evaluation, we report the results on 1670 non-empty transcripts out of the test split of 1692 samples.
\subsubsection{Flan-T5:}
For \texttt{Flan-T5}, we use the following prompts for the social message (\textbf{SM}), tone transition (\textbf{TT}), topic categorization(\textbf{Topic}) tasks: 
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{\underline{TT:}} 
\texttt{<Text from transcript>} \\
\textit{Based on the given text transcript from the advertisement, determine if the advertisement has any transitions in tones.} \\

\item \textbf{\underline{SM:}}
\texttt{<Text from transcript>} \\
\textit{An advertisement video has a social message if it provides awareness about any social issue.

\end{itemize}
For \texttt{GPT-4} we use the recently released API to pass the prompts for individual tasks.
For \texttt{Flan-T5} and \texttt{Opt-IML}, we use the publicly available models as a part of Huggingface \cite{wolf-etal-2020-transformers} library. For \texttt{alpaca}, we use the publicly available implementation in Github \cite{alpaca}. The large language models sometimes assign a label to the prediction that does not lie within the set of valid labels for the respective tasks. In the case of those samples, we randomly assign a label from the task-specific label taxonomy.
