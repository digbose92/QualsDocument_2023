\chapter{Advertisement video understanding through the lens of temporal context}

In this chapter, we will explore the role of temporal context in macro-level content understanding of dynamic sources, i.e., videos. Specifically, we consider advertisement videos due to their unique narrative structures of multiple short-term temporal context changes that are linked by a longer narrative thread. In order to study the context-driven approaches, we introduce a new ads-specific benchmark called \textbf{MM-AU} with salient narrative-driven tasks for macro-level understanding i.e., topic categorization, tone transition, and social relevance. 

\section{Video Understanding}

Video Understanding aims to identify semantic elements from videos, including: \textit{environment}, \textit{objects}, \textit{actions}, \textit{events}, \textit{attributes}, \textit{concepts/themes} \cite{diba_large_2020}. Recognition of the semantic elements requires processing temporal context across different time scales, including short-term and long-term. As shown in Fig \ref{short term and long term context}, the short-term context in videos centers around visible human actions for a limited duration. However, long-term context consists of an integrated narrative spanning across multiple short-term context changes. In the case of movies, the long-term context can even span the entire duration of the movie. In this work, we primarily look at advertisement videos due to their unique narrative structure consisting of multiple short-term context changes along with long-term linkage within a limited time frame.

\section{Advertisements - Context transitions}

In terms of context transitions, advertisements lie between action-oriented short videos and feature-length movies. In Fig \ref{ads_structure_set}, we can see that multiple short-term context changes are happening due to the following sequence of activities/interactions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Police activity starting
\item Police chief gathering 
\item Police vehicles are getting destroyed
\item Children playing with toys 
\end{itemize}
From the sequence of events, it can be inferred that even though the short-term temporal information indicates negative situations, the overall theme revolves around toys for kids.
Thus, the temporal context information needs to be processed both locally and globally for a holistic understanding of ads at macro-level.

    \subsubsection{Visual scene context}
    \subsubsection{Auditory context}
    Background music + audio events + speech (vocalizations)
    \subsubsection{Language based context}
\section{Advertisements as medium}
\subsection{Challenges}
Mention three cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Visual context changes sharply across shots but is tied together by an overall narrative (a diagram especially)
\item The visual narrative doesnâ€™t happen in isolation and is usually accompanied by a transition in musical tone (the contextual signal present in the background score/music sets the mood for the advertisement)
\item The verbal cues provide descriptions of the foreground activities, including character interactions and narrations about the overall theme/topic (Language driven foreground context representations)
