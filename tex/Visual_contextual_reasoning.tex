\chapter{Visual scene context recognition through multimodal guidance}

In this chapter, we consider the task of recognizing visual scene context in media content by leveraging pre-trained multimodal information.  
\section{Role of scene as contextual signal}
Visual scene context refers to the global context in the image, including the relationship of the target objects with the environment/location and other co-occurring objects \cite{Bar2004VisualOI}, \cite{Qiao2021ObjectLevelSC}. Visual scene context drives the likelihood of finding particular objects spatially co-located with each other. For example, as shown in Fig \ref{station_kitchen}, utensils are more likely to be present in the kitchen as compared to the train station. 
Apart from the domain of natural scenes, understanding the visual scene context is also important in the case of media content \cite{CMI} esp. movies and curated short content like advertisements. 
\par
In cinematic terms, \textit{mis-en-scene} \cite{Bordwell1979FilmAA} refers to how the different elements of a film are depicted and arranged in front of camera. Key components of \textit{mis-en-scene} include the actors with their different styles, \textbf{visual scenes} where the interactions take place, set design including lighting and camera placement, and the accompanying costumes and makeup of the artists. The visual scene is considered a crucial component since it sets the mood and provides a background for the various actions performed by the actors in the scene. Visual scenes in movies are often tied to social settings like weddings, birthday parties, and workplace gatherings that provide information about character interactions. Accurate recognition of visual scenes can help in uncovering the bias involved in the portrayal of under-represented characters vis-a-vis different scenes, e.g., fewer women shown in the office as compared to the kitchen. For content tagging tasks like genre classification, visual scenes provide context information like battlefield portrayals in action/adventure movies, space-shuttle in sci-fi movies, or courtrooms in dramas.

In the following section, we highlight certain challenges associated with visual scene recognition, especially w.r.t. movies.

\section{Movies vs Natural scenes}
Visual scene recognition, in the case of static images, is primarily driven by natural scenes due to large-scale datasets like SUN397 \cite{Xiao2010SUNDL} and Places-2\cite{zhou2017places}. However, there are certain inherent challenges in visual scene recognition for movies that need to be addressed, as shown in Fig \ref{Intro figure}.
\begin{figure}[!h]

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/Introduction_Figure.png}
  \caption{Overview diagram highlighting the challenges associated with visual scene recognition in movies (a) Domain mismatch between Natural scene images,(Source: \url{http://places2.csail.mit.edu/explore.html}) vs frames from Movies for \textbf{living room} (b) Movie centric visual scene classes like prison, control room etc that are absent from existing taxonomies (c) Change in visual scene between shots in the same movie clip.}
  \label{Intro figure}
\end{figure}
\textbf{\underline{Domain mismatch - scene images vs. movie frames:}} Visual scenes depicted in movies are distinct compared to natural scenes due to increased focus on actors, multiple activities, and viewpoint variations like extreme closeup, wide-angle shots etc. An example is shown in Fig.~\ref{Intro figure} (a) for images from Places2 dataset \cite{zhou2017places} and movie frames from Condensed Movies dataset \cite{bain2020condensed}.\\
\textbf{\underline{Lack of completeness in scene taxonomy:}} Movies depict both real-life and fictional scenarios that span a wide variety of visual scenes. As shown in Fig.~\ref{Intro figure}(b), certain movie-centric visual scene classes like \textit{battlefield}, \textit{control room}, \textit{prison}, \textit{war room}, \textit{funeral}, \textit{casino} are absent from existing public scene taxonomies associated with natural scene image and video datasets.\\
\textbf{\underline{Lack of shot-specific visual scene annotations:}} Existing datasets like Condensed Movies \cite{bain2020condensed} and VidSitu \cite{Sadhu_2021_CVPR} provide a {\em single} visual scene label for the entire movie clip (around 2 minutes long), obtained through descriptions provided as part of YouTube channel Fandango Movie clips \footnote{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3gNmTGu-TTbFPpfSs5kNkg}. In Fig.~\ref{Intro figure} (c), the provided description: \textit{Johnny Five (Tim Blaney) searches for his humanity in the \textbf{streets} of New York.} mentions only the visual scene \textbf{street}, while the initial set of events takes place inside \textbf{church}. Instead of considering a single scene label for the entire movie clip, shot-level visual scene annotation can help in tracking the scene change from \textbf{church} to \textbf{street}.
\section{Contributions}
In our work, we consider shots within a given movie clip as the fundamental units for visual scene analysis since shots consist of consecutive set of frames related to the same content, whose starting and ending points are triggered by recording using a single camera \cite{SBD}. Our contributions are as follows:
Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Language guided Movie-centric scene taxonomy:} We develop a movie-centric scene taxonomy by leveraging scene headers (sluglines) from movie scripts (language-based sources) and existing video datasets with scene labels like HVU\cite{diba_large_2020}. 
\item \textbf{Automatic shot tagging:} We utilize our generated scene taxonomy to automatically tag around 1.12M shots from 32K movie clips using a pretrained vision-language model called CLIP \cite{CLIP} based on a frame-wise aggregation scheme.  
\item \textbf{Multi-label scene classification:} We develop multi-label scene classification baselines using the shot-level tagged dataset called MovieCLIP and evaluate them on an independent shot-level dataset curated by human experts. 
\item \textbf{Downstream tasks:} We further extract feature representations from the baseline models pretrained on MovieCLIP and explore their applicability in diverse downstream tasks of multi-label scene and movie genre classification from web videos \cite{diba_large_2020} and trailers \cite{2019Moviescope}, respectively. 
\end{itemize}
\section{Related work}
\textbf{Image datasets for visual scene recognition:}
Image datasets for scene classification like MIT Indoor67 \cite{IndoorScenes} relied on categorizing a finite set of (67) indoor scene classes. A broad categorization into indoor, outdoor (natural) and outdoor (man-made) groups for 130K images across 397 subcategories was introduced by the SUN dataset \cite{xiao_sun_2016}. For large-scale scene recognition, the Places dataset \cite{zhou2017places} was developed with 434 scene labels spanning 10 million images. The scene taxonomy considered in the Places dataset was derived from the SUN dataset, followed by the careful merging of similar pairs. It should be noted that the curation of large-scale visual scene datasets like Places relied on crowd-sourced manual annotations over multiple rounds.\\
\textbf{Video datasets for visual scene recognition:} While there has been considerable progress in terms of action recognition capabilities from videos due to the introduction of large-scale datasets like Kinetics \cite{kinetics400}, ActivityNet \cite{caba2015activitynet}, AVA \cite{gu2018ava}, Something-Something \cite{Something-SomethingV2}, only few large scale datasets like HVU \cite{diba_large_2020} and Scenes, Objects and Actions (SOA) \cite{SOA} have focused on scene categorization with actions and associated objects. SOA was introduced as a multi-task multi-label dataset of social-media videos across 49 scenes with objects and actions but the taxonomy curation involves free-form tagging by human annotators followed by automatic cleanup. 
HVU \cite{diba_large_2020}, a recently released public dataset of web videos with 248 scene labels, relied on initial tag generation based on cloud APIs followed by human verification.\\
\textbf{Movie-centric visual scene recognition:} In the domain of scene recognition from movies, Hollywood scenes \cite{marszalek09} was first introduced with 10 scene classes extracted from headers in movie scripts across 3669 movie clips. A socially grounded approach was explored in Moviegraphs \cite{moviegraphs} with emphasis on the underlying interactions (relationships/situations) along with spatio-temporal localizations and associated visual scenes (59 classes).
For holistic movie understanding tasks, the Movienet dataset\cite{huang2020movienet} was introduced with the largest movie-centric scene taxonomy consisting of 90 place (visual scene) tags with segment-wise human annotations of entire movies. Instead of entire movie data, short movie clips sourced from YouTube channel of Fandango Movie clips were used for text-video retrieval in Condensed movies dataset \cite{bain2020condensed}, visual semantic role labeling \cite{Sadhu_2021_CVPR} and pretraining object-centric transformers \cite{transformers} for long-term video understanding in LVU dataset \cite{lvu2021}. While there is no explicit visual scene labeling, the raw descriptions available on Youtube with the movie clips have mentions of certain visual scene classes.
\\
MovieCLIP, our curated dataset for visual scene context recognition, is built on top of movie clips available as a part of Condensed Movies dataset \cite{bain2020condensed}. A comparative overview of MovieCLIP and other image and video datasets with visual scene labels is shown in Table~\ref{Overview}. In comparison with previous video-centric works, our taxonomy generation relies on domain-centric data sources like movie scripts and auxiliary world knowledge from web-video-based sources like HVU with minimal human-in-the-loop supervision for taxonomy refinement.

\textbf{Knowledge transfer from pretrained multimodal models:}
Vision language(V-L) based pretraining methods involve learning transferable visual representations based on various pretext tasks associated with image and text pairs. Examples of pretext tasks in V-L domain include prediction of masked words in captions based on visual cues in ICMLM \cite{sariyildiz2020icmlm}, pretraining image encoders based on bicaptioning objective in VirTex \cite{desai2021virtex} and contrastive alignment of image-caption pairs in CLIP \cite{CLIP}. Leveraging features from CLIP's visual and text encoders have improved existing vision-language tasks \cite{Shen2021HowMC} and enabled open-vocabulary object detection \cite{Gu2021OpenvocabularyOD}, and language-driven semantic segmentation \cite{Li2022LanguagedrivenSS}. In our work, we use the pretrained visual and text encoders of CLIP and utilize it as a noisy annotator by tagging movie shots based on our curated visual scene taxonomy.

\section{Language driven taxonomy curation}

Based on domain-specific challenges mentioned in Fig \ref{Intro figure}, we can see the need for a taxonomy curation phase for visual scenes in movies. In this section, we outline the process involved in curating a visual scene taxonomy based on the domain information present in movie scripts and the pre-existing scene information present in auxiliary video datasets.

\subsection{Sources of visual scene information}
Movie scripts have been used as external sources for describing and annotating videos through script and subtitle alignment methods in \cite{10.1007/978-3-540-88693-8_12}, \cite{Everingham2006HelloMN}, \cite{Laptevactionscvpr}, \cite{Rohrbach2015ADF}. Movie scripts contain \textit{sluglines} that provide information about visual scenes, time of the day, and whether the action takes place in indoor or outdoor settings.

\begin{figure}[!h]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/sources_of_information_visual_scene_taxonomy.png}
  \caption{Sources of visual scene information: (a) Sample slugline from a movie script that contains visual scene, time of day, and location (b) Word cloud showing the distribution of visual scene labels in HVU \cite{diba_large_2020} dataset.}
  \label{sources of information}
\end{figure}

We parse 156k sluglines from an in-house set of 1434 movie scripts. For each slugline, we automatically extract entities after the ``\textbf{EXT.}''(exterior) or ``\textbf{INT.}''(interior) tags like \textit{Hospital room}, \textit{River}, \textit{War room} etc.
Using this procedure, we extract 173 unique visual scene labels. Our taxonomy generation process is motivated by visual scenes in movies with sluglines from scripts as seed sources along with auxiliary sources.
Since the set of labels from movie scripts is not exhaustive, we also consider auxiliary sources, especially web video datasets with visual scene labels like HVU \cite{diba_large_2020}. We consider HVU as source of additional labels since the taxonomy (248 visual scene classes) is semi-automatically curated for short-trimmed videos, having similar nature to movie shots. We don’t consider Places2 \cite{zhou2017places} dataset since the taxonomy is primarily curated for natural
scenes, which are distinct from movie-centric visual scenes. Sample slugline from a movie script and a word cloud showing the distribution of visual scene labels is shown in Fig \ref{sources of information}.
